# Database Migration Strategy

## Current Status

### Prisma Implementation
- Complete Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Models defined:
  * User
  * Item
  * Listing
  * MarketResearchData
  * Order
  * Shipment
  * AnalyticsData
  * AnalyticsSnapshot
  * Conversation
  * Message

### SQLAlchemy Implementation Progress
1. Base infrastructure in place:
   - `db.py`: Async database connection management
   - `db_client.py`: Prisma-like interface implementation
   - Model files created in `app/models/`

2. Backward Compatibility
   - DatabaseClient class mimics Prisma's interface
   - ModelClient provides generic CRUD operations
   - Async session management implemented

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Completed)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy async setup
- ✅ Database client implementation
- ✅ Model definitions
- ✅ Prisma-like interface

### Phase 2: Migration Setup (Recommended)
1. Install Alembic:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   alembic init migrations
   ```

2. Configure Alembic:
   - Update `alembic.ini` with database URL
   - Set up model imports in `env.py`
   - Configure async environment

3. Generate Initial Migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial_schema"
   ```

### Phase 3: Data Migration (To Be Implemented)
1. Create data migration script to:
   - Read data from Prisma database
   - Insert data using SQLAlchemy models
   - Verify data integrity

2. Testing strategy:
   - Run migrations in test environment
   - Verify data consistency
   - Test application functionality

### Phase 4: Deployment (Future)
1. Backup existing database
2. Run Alembic migrations
3. Execute data migration
4. Verify application functionality
5. Remove Prisma dependencies

## Implementation Notes

### Model Mapping
All Prisma models have corresponding SQLAlchemy models:
- `User` → `app/models/user.py`
- `Item` → `app/models/item.py`
- `Listing` → `app/models/listing.py`
- etc.

### Type Conversions
- Prisma `String` → SQLAlchemy `String`
- Prisma `DateTime` → SQLAlchemy `DateTime`
- Prisma `Json` → SQLAlchemy `JSON`
- Prisma `@default(uuid())` → SQLAlchemy `uuid.uuid4`

### Relationship Handling
- One-to-Many relationships use SQLAlchemy `relationship()`
- Foreign keys defined using SQLAlchemy `ForeignKey`
- Cascade delete behaviors maintained

## Recommendations

1. Database Migration Tool
   - Use Alembic for SQLAlchemy migrations
   - Benefits:
     * Automatic migration generation
     * Version control for schema changes
     * Async support
     * Rollback capability

2. Migration Approach
   - Implement migrations incrementally
   - Test thoroughly in staging environment
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Use feature flags to control migration rollout

3. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for new SQLAlchemy models
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - Migration tests for data consistency
   - Performance comparison tests

4. Monitoring and Rollback
   - Monitor query performance
   - Track error rates during migration
   - Maintain backup for rollback capability
   - Document rollback procedures

## Security Considerations

1. Data Protection
   - Backup all data before migration
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit
   - Maintain access controls during migration

2. Credentials
   - Use environment variables for database credentials
   - Rotate credentials after migration
   - Review and update access permissions

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration strategy
2. Set up Alembic for migration management
3. Create test environment for migration testing
4. Develop and test data migration scripts
5. Plan production deployment timeline

Note: This migration strategy should be reviewed and approved before implementation. The actual migration process should be carefully planned and executed with proper testing and rollback procedures in place.
